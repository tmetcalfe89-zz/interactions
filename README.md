# interactions
Add (right-click) interactions to Minecraft.

This is a simple mod to add interactions on right-click. It is intended for use by modpack developers and does nothing out of the box.

It adds a folder in the Minecraft directory called "interactions". Create a JSON file in there with any name you'd like and add entries matching the following:

```
[
  {
    "targetBlock": "<namespace>:<block>:<metadata>",      // The block that is interacted with must match this to activate this block.
    "heldItem": "<namespace>:<item>:<metadata>",          // The player must have this item in their hand.
    "replacementBlock": "<namespace>:<block>:<metadata>", // If this interaction replaces the target block, it replaces with this. (optional)
    "replacementChance": "<x>:<y>",                       // If this interaction replaces the target block, it has x in y chances to do so. (optional)
    "dropItem": "<namespace>:<item>:<metadata>",          // If this interaction drops an item, it drops this. (optional)
    "dropOnlyOnSuccess": "<true/false>",                  // If this interaction drops an item, setting this to true only allows the drop if block replacement was successful. (optional)
    "dropChance": "<x>:<y>",                              // If this interaction drops an item, it has x in y chances to do so. (optional)
    "dropCount": "<x>:<y>",                               // If this interactions drops an item, it drops between x and y (y can be left out for an exact amount). (optional)
    "damage": "<x>",                                      // If this interaction damages the hand item, it does this much damage. (optional)
    "damageOnlyOnSuccess": "<true/false>",                // If this interaction damages the hand item, setting this to true only allows the damage if block replacement was successful. (optional)
    "damageChance": "<x>:<y>",                             // If this interaction damages the hand item, it has x in y chances to do so. (optional),
    "particleType": "<particletype>",                      // If this interaction emits particles, it emits these particles. (optional),
    "particleCount": "<x>:<y>"                            // If this interaction emits particles, it emits between x and y (y can be left out for an exact amount). (optional)
  }

# Examples

Here's an example that turns dirt into coarse dirt when a player interacts with it with a stick in their hand.

```
[
  {
    "targetBlock": "minecraft:dirt:0",
    "heldItem": "minecraft:stick:1",
    "replacementBlock": "minecraft:dirt:1"
  }
]
```

Here's an example that drops a diamond from diamond ore and turns the ore into stone when a player interacts with it with a diamond pickaxe in their hand. The pickaxe takes 1 damage.

```
[
  {
    "targetBlock": "minecraft:diamond_ore:0",
    "dropItem": "minecraft:diamond:0",
    "heldItem": "minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:0",
    "replacementBlock": "minecraft:stone:0",
    "damage": "1"
  }
]
```

Here's the above example, but with (lots of) particles.
Note: Using bonemeal on a crop or tree emits 15 happyVillager particles.
```
[
  {
    "targetBlock": "minecraft:diamond_ore:0",
    "dropItem": "minecraft:diamond:0",
    "heldItem": "minecraft:diamond_pickaxe:0",
    "replacementBlock": "minecraft:stone:0",
    "damage": "1"
    "particleType": "happyVillager",
    "particleCount": "30:60"
  }
]
```

# Pros

* Easy to use.
* Damage works with both damageable items (in which case it damages the item) and undamageable items (in which case it consumes items in the stack).
* Works with mod items and blocks.
* Works with damage/metadata.

# Cons

* Doesn't hook in with other APIs.
* Doesn't work with ore dictionaries.
* Doesn't work with tool levels. For example, you can't have say an iron pickaxe is required, and then have it automatically know diamond works as well.

# Notes

* Damage on heldItem is ignored if the item is damageable when checking if it should trigger the interaction. You've still gotta put it in there.
* Cons are subject to improvement.
